# SmartMenu

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to provide an easy-to-use and highly interactive interface that accepts specific input from a user to provide a unique output. Apart from its use as a configurator, it also provides data analysis functionalities.
SmartMenu not only presents the menu of one particular restaurant in a hotel but also handles functions of two other dining areas along with a conference hall and room service option. Based on the availability of a particular food selection, the dish is automatically shown in the restaurant picked by the user. SmartMenu also helps in bill generation. The data visualisation tool helps to keep track of the hotel statistics. Rough average number of customers, restaurant selection by popularity, number of employees per year and other such graphs can be accessed here. Based on previous data collected from the restaurant, it also displays the customer’s favourites (popular choices of food). 

## Scope
This project has a variety of applications— apart from its usage in restaurants where it can be installed on the table, it can also be used in drive-thrus and food courts— particularly in places having a large variety of dining choices as it can handle multiple dining ‘profiles’. The visualisation section can also be completely stripped apart from the whole program for a hotel management system. 
Several other functions can be added:
- opening/closing of restaurants based on time of day
- more layers of customer attributes such as frequency of visits
- table capacity and availability
- order ticketing
- auto-suggestion food combinations
